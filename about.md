Hi! I'm **Krzysztof Madej** and on the internet you can find me as **kmadof**. I'm a happy father and husband.

I am a Developer with experience in building enterprise systems. I am passionate about bringing optimization and clean design in large-scale systems. I think about myself as software craftsmanship. In my areas of interest are software design, software architecture, cloud computing, DevOps practices and leadership. I enjoy a lot learning about programming, design systems, cognitive science. I pay attention to C# evolution which is my first choice language.

In the past long-distance runner and at the moment amateur mountain hiker. I like to charge my batteries in the nature. I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card and enthusiast of history books.

I like to challenge myself and prove my knowledge getting some certifications:
