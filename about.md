Hello there! I'm **Krzysztof Madej** and on the internet I use nick **kmadof**. I'm a happy father and husband.

I am a Dev Lead with experience in building enterprise systems. I am passionate about bringing optimization and clean design in large-scale systems. I think about myself as software craftsmanship. In my areas of interest are software design, software architecture and leadership. I enjoy a lot learning about DDD, functional programming with F# at the top and cloud computing with Azure. I pay attention to C# evolution which is my first choice language.

In the past long-distance runner and at the moment amateur mountain hiker. I like to rest my batteries in nature. I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card and enthusiast of history books.
