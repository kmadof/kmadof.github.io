Hi! I'm **Krzysztof Madej** and on the internet I use nick **kmadof**. I'm a father, husband and .NET developer.

Currently, I work in AXA as a dev lead and this is definitely the longest professional journey I've ever had. On daily basis, I struggle there with business and development challenges on a platform to sell insurances. On my free time I read books and watch courses about:

* DDD,
* F#,
* C#,
* Azure,
* software design and architecture,
* team leading.
